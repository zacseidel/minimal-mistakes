## How & Why I Write

### How:  The Process

1. Use Github pages
2. Prose.io
3. Notes in Apple Notes
4. Use the PARA & CODE methods from "Building a Second Brain"

### Why

Because writing gives the gift of perspective.

"Free time machine."

More data on the most unknown thing in the universe.

It is a gift.


### Some missteps & Motivations

For a long time I did Wordpress.  The ads really bothered me.

Then I tried substack, but the default organization bothered me.

I also struggle with what I'm doing:
1. Writing is scalable, so it is the path to wealth, cachet, etc.  And attention and readership is fun: I want to have influence.
2. But more than that, I want to be myself.  I don't want to be an influencer, at the mercy of attention.  I want to become more full of character, more myself, more autonomouse.
